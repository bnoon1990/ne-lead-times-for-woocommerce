This plugin enables lead times to be added to products in WooCommerce. 

== Description ==

This plugin, Noon Elite Lead Times For WooCommerce, is designed to enhance your WooCommerce store by adding lead times to your products. 

With this plugin, you can set a specific lead time for each product in your store. This is particularly useful for stores that sell made-to-order products or products that are not immediately available for shipping.
